# Planned version: 0.9.2.0 
- Direct interaction between user program and io, no Function block calls are needed (as in previous version).
- A complete overhaul of architecture for stability and speed => beware that the driver, by design, will not be backward compatible. This should not be a dealbreaker in comparisson to the gain in ease of use.
- As debugging this mechanism is tedious and time consuming I cannot give an accurate release date.


# Current version: 0.9.0.3
- Initial Release
- Works as a function block, so all interactions with the hardware must be done via this function block in the user program
