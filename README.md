CODESYS 3 Library for Monarco HAT

The Monarco HAT was lacking a decent CODESYS library, so I decided to write it myself.

The main components are;
- devicedescription file,
- library file,
- example project file,
- package file (CODESYS installer) which contains the above files in a user friendly installer.

prerequisitories;
A Raspberry pi with the Monarco HAT,
CODESYS 3.5 runtime component installed on pi (Demo/licensed),

Either install package via package manager or install loose components.


ENJOY!
